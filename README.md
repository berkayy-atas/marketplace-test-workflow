# üì¶ MyApp Backup Action

This GitHub Action performs a full mirror backup of the current repository, compresses it using **Zstandard (ZSTD)**, and uploads it to an external API using a secure activation token.

---

## üöÄ Usage

```yaml
- name: Run MyApp Backup
  uses: berkayy-atas/marketplace-test-workflow@v1.0.15
  with:
    activation_code: ${{ secrets.ACTIVATION_CODE }}
    encryption_key: ${{ secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
```

`activation_code` is **required**. It is your personal access code to the API and should be stored securely as a secret in your repository.
`encryption_key` is **required**. It is your personal encryption key for lock and open the file and should be stored securely as a secret in your repository.

---

## üîß Optional: Select backup modules

You can control which parts of the repository to include in the backup using optional flags:

| Name                       | Default | Description                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `backup_issues`            | `true`  | Include issues and their metadata in the backup     |
| `backup_prs`               | `true`  | Include pull requests, their branches, and comments |
| `backup_labels_milestones` | `true`  | Include repository labels and milestones            |

### Example:
Backup only repository and PRs, but skip issues and labels/milestones:

```yaml
- name: Run MyApp Backup with custom modules
  uses: berkayy-atas/marketplace-test-workflow@v1.0.15
  with:
    activation_code: ${{ secrets.ACTIVATION_CODE }}
    encryption_key: ${{ secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
    backup_issues: false
    backup_prs: true
    backup_labels_milestones: false
```


## üîß Optional: use_org_id

You can optionally add the `use_org_id` parameter:

```yaml
- name: Run MyApp Backup with Org ID
  uses: berkayy-atas/marketplace-test-workflow@v1.0.15
  with:
    activation_code: ${{ secrets.ACTIVATION_CODE }}
    encryption_key: ${{ secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY }}
    use_org_id: true
```

### What does `use_org_id` do?
- If omitted or set to `false`, the action uses the **repository ID** as the unique identifier.
  - This means **each repository** will be treated as a separate **endpoint**.
- If set to `true`, the action retrieves the **organization ID** instead.
  - This causes **all repositories** under the organization to be considered **a single endpoint** by the external system.

**Default:** `false`
